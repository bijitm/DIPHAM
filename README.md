# DIPHAM
This sets up the Hamiltonian for two structureless rotating identical diatomic molecules interacting with static and microwave fields; finds its eigenvalues (adiabats) as a function of intermolecular distance and angle with the field axis.
For microwave fields, linear polarization along z, or right circular polarization along x-y with non-zero ellipticity, is allowed.
